<h1>19. Instrument Reference</h1>
<p><a href="glossary.html#instrument">Instruments</a> are fundamental to playing audio content in FMOD Studio, as well as for triggering certain kinds of behavior. This chapter describes the various types of instrument, as well as detailed information about their properties, behaviors, and features.</p>
<h2 id="common-instrument-properties"><a href="#common-instrument-properties">19.1 Common Instrument Properties</a></h2>
<p>While each type of instrument has a unique list of <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#controller">controls</span class="dead-link"> and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#property">properties</span class="dead-link">, there are some features that all instruments have in common.</p>
<h3 id="instrument-trigger-region-properties"><a href="#instrument-trigger-region-properties">19.1.1 Instrument Trigger Region Properties</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Trigger Region" src="images/single-instrument-trigger-region.png" /></p>
<p>All instruments are displayed as <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger regions</a> on the <a href="glossary.html#track">tracks</a> and <a href="glossary.html#action-sheet">action sheets</a> of <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a>. These trigger regions display certain important properties of the instrument at all times.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> (Text field)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Instrument Name and Color" src="images/instrument-name.png" /></dt>
<dd>The name of an instrument appears at the top of its trigger region. By default, instruments are named after their instrument type or content. If an instrument's name is something other than its instrument type, its type is parenthetically appended to the name displayed on the trigger region.</dd>
<dt><strong>Color</strong> (Color)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Instrument Name and Color" src="images/instrument-name.png" /></dt>
<dd>The color of an instrument's trigger region has no effect on in-game behavior, but can make the instrument easier to identify at a glance in FMOD Studio. When first created, an instrument's color is determined by its type.</dd>
<dt><strong>Sheet</strong> (Tab)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Sheet Tabs" src="images/parameterTabBar.png" /></dt>
<dd>The action sheet or parameter sheet on which an instrument's trigger region appears determines which parameter or event state can trigger the instrument.</dd>
<dt><strong>Position</strong> (Multiple means of editing)</dt>
<dd>For instruments on parameter sheets, the horizontal position and length of the trigger region defines the range of parameter values that can trigger the instrument. For synchronous instruments, the horizontal position of the trigger region also determines which part of the associated asset plays when the instrument is overlapped by the timeline's playback position.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Parameter units.</dd>
<dt><strong>Length</strong> (Multiple means of editing)</dt>
<dd>For instruments on parameter sheets, the horizontal position and length of the trigger region defines the range of parameter values that can trigger the instrument. For synchronous instruments, the length of the trigger region also determines when the timeline's playback position stops overlapping the instrument, and thus when the instrument must stop playing.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Parameter units.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="instrument-deck-properties"><a href="#instrument-deck-properties">19.1.2 Instrument Deck Properties</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Instrument Deck Panel" src="images/single-instrument-deck.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to the properties displayed on their trigger regions, instruments have properties that appear in the deck while the instrument's trigger region is selected in the editor. Information about specific deck properties can be found in the sections describing individual instrument types, later in this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="trigger-behavior-properties"><a href="#trigger-behavior-properties">19.1.3 Trigger Behavior Properties</a></h3>
<p>Additional properties can be found in instruments' <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#trigger-behavior-drawer">trigger behavior drawers</span class="dead-link">. Instrument trigger behavior drawers are divided into two sections, "Conditions" and "Delay &amp; Quantization." These sections define the circumstances in which the instrument can be triggered.</p>
<p><img alt="Trigger Behavior Drawer in Quantization Mode" src="images/trigger-behavior-drawer.png" /> <img alt="Trigger Behavior Drawer In Delay Mode" src="images/trigger-behavior-drawer-delay-mode.png" /></p>
<p>There are three kinds of trigger condition: Probability, parameter, and event. Instruments can be given all three kinds, in any combination. For information about how to add trigger conditions to events, see the <a href="working-with-instruments.html#trigger-conditions">Trigger Conditions</a> section of the <a href="working-with-instruments.html">Working with Instruments</a> chapter.</p>
<p><span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#probability-trigger-condition">Probability trigger conditions</span class="dead-link"> specify a chance that the instrument triggers each time the instrument's other trigger behavior dictates that it should be triggered, i.e.: when the instrument is overlapped by the playback position, the playback position is at a bar or beat to which the instrument is quantized, and either all the instrument's parameter and event trigger conditions are met (if the instrument's AND/OR buttons are set to "AND") or at least one of the instrument's parameter and event trigger conditions are met (if the instrument's AND/OR buttons are set to "OR"). An instrument can have no more than one probability trigger condition.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Probability</strong> (Toggle button)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Probability Toggle Button" src="images/probability-toggle-button.png" /></dt>
<dd>If toggled on, the instrument has a probability trigger condition. If toggled off, the instrument does not, and the value of the chance property is ignored.</dd>
<dt><strong>Chance</strong> (Number box)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Chance Number Box" src="images/chance-number-box.png" /></dt>
<dd>This is the percentage chance that the instrument is triggered. This property is checked against a random number each time the instrument's other trigger behavior dictates it should be triggered.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Percentage Points.<br />
<strong>Automatable.</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>Parameter trigger conditions specify a parameter and a range of values into which that parameter's value must fall for the condition to be true. Event trigger conditions specify <a href="advanced-topics.html#play-state">play states</a> that the event must be in for the condition to be true. An instrument can have any number of event or parameter trigger conditions.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>AND/OR</strong> (Radio buttons)</dt>
<dt><img alt="AND/OR Radio Buttons" src="images/and-or-buttons.png" /></dt>
<dd>These buttons determine which event or parameter conditions must be met for the instrument to be triggered when there are multiple event or parameter conditions present. If they are set to "OR," only one of the instrument's event or parameter conditions must be met; whereas if they are set to "AND," all of the instrument's event and parameter conditions must be met.</dd>
<dt><strong>Conditions list</strong> (Multiple means of editing)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Trigger Conditions List" src="images/conditions-list.png" /></dt>
<dd>The conditions list contains all the parameter and event conditions associated with the instrument. It does not include the instrument's probability trigger condition, if any. Each event or parameter trigger condition has properties of its own.</dd>
<dt><strong>Parameter Name</strong> (Text field)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Parameter Name" src="images/parameter-trigger-condition-name.png" /></dt>
<dd>The name of the parameter used by a parameter condition. Changing this property alters the name of the <a href="glossary.html#preset-parameter">preset parameter</a>.</dd>
<dt><strong>Parameter Range</strong> (Ribbon slider)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Parameter Range" src="images/parameter-trigger-condition-range.png" /></dt>
<dd>The range of values that the parameter must have for the parameter condition to be met (or not met, if the condition is inverted). This property only appears for parameter conditions based on built-in parameters and discrete and continuous user parameters.</dd>
<dt><strong>Parameter Value</strong> (Dropdown menu)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Parameter Value" src="images/parameter-trigger-condition-value.png" /></dt>
<dd>The specific value that the parameter must have for the parameter condition to be met (or not met, if the condition is inverted). This property only appears for parameter conditions based on labeled parameters.</dd>
<dt><strong>Inverted</strong> (Toggle button)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Inverted Toggle Button" src="images/inverted-button.png" /></dt>
<dd>This toggle button determines whether the parameter's value must match or not match the parameter condition's parameter range or parameter value for the condition to be met. If inverted is toggled off, the parameter's value must match the parameter condition's parameter range or value; if it is toggled on, the parameter's value must not match the parameter condition's range or value.</dd>
<dt><strong>Polyphony</strong> (Number box)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Polyphony Number Box" src="images/trigger-condition-polyphony.png" /></dt>
<dd>Polyphony defines the maximum number of simultaneously playing <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#instrument-instance">instances of the instrument</span class="dead-link"> that can be triggered by the parent <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">event instance</a>. If the event instance attempts to trigger a new instance of the instrument while the number of playing instances of that instrument triggered by the same event instance is equal to the polyphony, whether a new instance is played and an existing one culled depends on the instrument's stealing behavior.</dd>
<dt><strong>Stealing</strong> (Dropdown menu)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Stealing Mode Dropdown Menu" src="images/trigger-condition-stealing.png" /></dt>
<dd>The stealing mode of an instrument determines what happens when the instrument is triggered and playing a new instance of the instrument would cause the number of simultaneously playing instances of that instrument triggered by the same event instance to exceed the instrument's polyphony. If stealing is set to oldest, the oldest instance of the instrument immediately stops as the new instance begins; whereas if stealing is set to none, no instance of the instrument is stopped and no new instance of the instrument begins playing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to conditions, the trigger behavior drawer also contains controls for delay and quantization.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Time/Tempo control</strong> (Radio buttons)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Time/Tempo Radio Buttons" src="images/trigger-condition-time-tempo.png" /></dt>
<dd>If this control is set to time, the instrument waits to play for a period of time after being triggered defined by the delay interval property: If the instrument is asynchronous, it waits for the period of time specified by the delay interval property before playing; and if it is sychronous, it only plays if it is still overlapped by the parameter playback position after the period of time specified by the delay interval. If this control is instead set to tempo, the instrument only triggers on specific beats or bars specified by the quantization interval property.</dd>
<dt><strong>Delay Interval</strong> (Ribbon slider)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Delay Interval" src="images/trigger-condition-delay-interval.png" /></dt>
<dd>Delay interval defines the period of time that must elapse after the instrument is triggered before it begins playing. If the minimum and maximum values of the ribbon slider are the same, the period of time's length is fixed. If the minimum and maximum values of the ribbon slider differ, the period of time's length is randomized within that range each time the instrument's trigger conditions are met.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Milliseconds or seconds.</dd>
<dt><strong>Quantization Interval</strong> (Radio buttons)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Quantization Interval" src="images/trigger-condition-quantization-interval.png" /></dt>
<dd>An instrument's quantization interval specifies on which of the timeline's beats or bars the instrument's trigger conditions are checked while the instrument is overlapped by the playback position. The bar and beat numbers used by this property are those that appear on the timeline when the editor is set to beats mode, as defined by the event's <a href="glossary.html#tempo-marker">tempo markers</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="single-instrument"><a href="#single-instrument">19.2 Single Instrument</a></h2>
<p>Single instruments are a kind of <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> that can hold only one <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a>. As such, single instruments lack <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlists</a>, but otherwise closely resemble <a href="glossary.html#multi-instrument">multi instruments</a>. Single instruments are the foundation of most other instrument types.</p>
<h3 id="single-instrument-trigger-region-properties"><a href="#single-instrument-trigger-region-properties">19.2.1 Single Instrument Trigger Region Properties</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Trigger Region" src="images/single-instrument-trigger-region.png" /></p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Content Graphic</strong> (Graphic)</dt>
<dd>The waveform of the <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio asset</a> associated with a single instrument is displayed on its <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a>. If the instrument is <a href="glossary.html#asynchronous">asynchronous</a>, this content is surrounded by a border. If the instrument is <a href="glossary.html#synchronous">synchronous</a> and its <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#play-count">play count</span class="dead-link"> is greater than one, multiple copies of the waveform may be displayed, provided the trigger region is long enough.</dd>
<dt><strong>Fade Curves</strong> (Mouse-editable graphics)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Fade Curves" src="images/single-instrument-fade-curves.png" /></dt>
<dd>A fade curve defines how an instrument's volume ramps from silence to full volume when the playback position moves onto the instrument, or how it ramps from full volume to silence when the playback position moves off the instrument. Instruments on action sheets can not have fade curves. Each instrument on a parameter sheet can have one fade curve for its left side, and one fade curve for its right. Instruments do not have fade curves by default.</dd>

<dd>Volume defines the gain applied to the instrument's output.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Decibels.<br />
<strong>Automatable and Modulatable.</strong></dd>
<dt><strong>Pitch</strong> (Number box)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Pitch" src="images/instrument-pitch.png" /></dt>
<dd>Pitch defines the amount of pitch adjustment applied to the instrument's output. The pitch properties of instruments on parameter sheets other than the timeline sheet are compatible with <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#autopitch-modulator">autopitch modulators</span class="dead-link">.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Semitones.<br />
<strong>Automatable and Modulatable.</strong></dd>
<dt><strong>Start Offset</strong> (Number box)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Start Offset" src="images/start-offset.png" /></dt>
<dd>The start offset of a single instrument determines the point within its associated audio asset from which it starts playing when the instrument is triggered, expressed as a percentage of the length of the audio file associated with the instrument. For asynchronous instruments, this directly determines the position from which the associated audio file begins to play when the instrument is triggered. For synchronous instruments, this offset is added to the position of the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> inside the instrument's waveform, and so is an exception to the rule that the part of a single instrument's waveform that plays is the part of the waveform that's overlapped by the playback position.<br />
<strong>Units</strong>: Percentage points.<br />
<strong>Automatable and Modulatable.</strong></dd>
<dt><strong>Async</strong> (Toggle button)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Async Toggle Button" src="images/single-instrument-async.png" /></dt>
<dd>A single instrument's synchronous or asynchronous state determines whether it is possible to seek or scrub within the waveform displayed on its trigger region. If an instrument is synchronous, the section of the waveform underneath the timeline playback position is the part of the asset that plays while the instrument is triggered; whereas if the instrument is asychronous, the playback position's location on the instrument has no effect on which part of the associated asset plays. Instruments on parameters other than the timeline are always asynchronous. For more information about synchronous and asynchronous instruments, see the <a href="working-with-instruments.html#synchronous-and-asynchronous-instruments">Synchronous and Asynchronous Instruments</a> section of the <a href="working-with-instruments.html">Working With Instruments</a> chapter.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cut</strong> (Toggle button)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Cut Toggle Button" src="images/cut-button.png" /></dt>
<dd>An asynchronous instrument's cut mode determines whether it stops playing when its trigger conditions cease being met. The cut toggle button only appears in the deck of asynchronous instruments.</dd>
<dt><strong>Loop Instrument</strong> (Toggle button)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Loop Instrument Toggle Button" src="images/single-instrument-loop-instrument.png" /></dt>
<dd>Looping a synchronous instrument causes it to loop in accordance with its play count property. Specifically, the play count of a synchronous instrument is the number of times its content graphic is iterated on that instrument's trigger region, limited by the amount of horizontal space on that trigger region; whereas the play count of an asynchronous instrument is the number of times that instrument plays its associated audio file when triggered. This toggle button is visually identical to the Loop Playlist button found on multi instruments, but differs in function.</dd>
<dt><strong>Play Count</strong> (Number box)</dt>
<dt><img alt="Play Count Enabled" src="images/play-count-enabled.png" /> <img alt="Play Count Disabled" src="images/play-count-disabled.png" /></dt>
<dd>This property is only available for instruments whose loop instrument toggle buttons are enabled. It determines the number of times that instrument can loop, as described in the sections on those toggle buttons. If this property is infinite on an asynchronous instrument, the associated instrument or playlist will finish playing out its current loop when the instrument is untriggered, then stop; but if it is finite, it will loop a number of times equal to play count even if the instrument is untriggered before it is finished.</dd>

<dd>The start offset of a multi instrument determines the point within the first playlist entry it selects to play from when the instrument is triggered, expressed as a percentage of the length of that playlist entry. It only affects the first playlist entry selected each time the instrument is triggered. In asynchronous instruments, this directly determines the position from which the associated <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> begins to play when the instrument is triggered. For single, multi, and event instrument playlist entries in synchronous instruments, this offset is added to the position of the playback position inside the instrument's waveform, and so is an exception to the rule that the part of a single instrument's waveform that plays is the part of the waveform that's overlapped by the playback position.<br />

<p>A silence instrument is a kind of <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> that does not produce any output. When added to a consecutive <a href="glossary.html#action-sheet">action sheet</a> or the <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlist</a> of a <a href="glossary.html#multi-instrument">multi instrument</a> or <a href="glossary.html#scatterer-instrument">scatterer instrument</a>, a silence instrument allows you define a circumstance in which the action sheet or instrument does not produce any sound.</p>
<p>Silence instruments are always asynchronous.</p>

<h2 id="snapshot-instrument"><a href="#snapshot-instrument">19.9 Snapshot Instrument</a></h2>
<p>Snapshot instruments are a type of <a href="instrument-reference.html#event-instrument">event instrument</a>. Triggering a snapshot instrument causes a new instance of the corresponding <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshot</a> to begin playing. When the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> leaves the snapshot instrument, the instrument is untriggered, and the corresponding snapshot instance stops.</p>
<p>Each time a snapshot instrument is triggered, a new instance of the snapshot begins to play. This means that multiple simultaneous instances of the same snapshot can play at the same time, whether by multiple different snapshot instruments or as a result of the same snapshot instrument being triggered more than once in one or more instances of its parent event. Snapshot instances can also be started and stopped by your game's code.</p>
<p>The property values of a snapshot instance started by a snapshot instrument are affected by the snapshot instrument's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#intensity">intensity</span class="dead-link">.</p>

<dd>A snapshot instrument's fade curve defines how the snapshot instance's intensity ramps from zero to the value of its intensity property when the playback position moves onto the instrument, or how it ramps from the value of its intensity property to zero when the playback position moves off the instrument. Instruments on action sheets can not have fade curves. Each instrument on a parameter sheet can have one fade curve for its left side, and one fade curve for its right. Instruments do not have fade curves by default.</dd>
